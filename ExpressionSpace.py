			Represents the points in the space in a very particular fashion.
			While they are sequentially accessible from points, they are also
			interconnected in a directed graph whose traversal makes recursive
			manipulation of the space very efficient.

			A point are linked directly only to the points at Hamming distance
			1 from it (i.e. those coords are this points coords with exactly
			one bit flipped), but the graph is directed so that each node only
			links to the points whose coords contain more 1-bits than its own.
			Thus, all possible links exist in exactly one direction.

			Links where differing 1-bits is at a higher position than any
			1-bit in its coords are called strong links, while the rest are
			called weak links. Traversing the graph using only strong links
			ensures that each node is visited exactly once. A method typically
			uses this by comparing with weakly linked nodes an recursing on
			strongly linked ones, ensuring total coverage of the nodes and
			edges of the graph with minimal redundancy.

			The graph has one further advantage over iteration through points:
			if one uses the links in the order they are present in links, a
			point is guaranteed to be updated through strong-links recursion
			before it is touched through a weak link. This is often a critical
			feature that makes up for the recursion overhead.

			If the points are ordered numerically by coords, the ith point
			that has j 1-bits will have dim-j links, of which dim-j-i are
			strong. Thus, the point with coords==0 has dim links, all strong,
			while the point with coords==mask has no links at all.
